I will add more info later on.

You can try the chatbot here --> https://colab.research.google.com/github/eremophobia/ChocolateChatBot/blob/main/ChocolateChatBot.ipynb --> Press "Ctlr + F9" --> Click "Run anyway".

If you don't know what to type into the textbox you can try this: hi, types of chocolate, process, ingredients.

To close the textbox just type in "bye".

(you can also play around with the code)
